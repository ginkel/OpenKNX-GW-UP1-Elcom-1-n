# OpenKNX: Elcom-1+n-Gateway

This repository hosts the OpenKNX-based firmware for an Elcom-1+n KNX Gateway that can interface a legacy Elcom-1+n doorbell system with KNX. It supports both the main doorbell and the storey call ("Etagenruf") as well as actuating the door opener.

Its hardware is based on the [OpenKNX UP1 System](https://github.com/OpenKNX/OpenKNX/wiki/OpenKNX-UP1) used in combination with a custom application PCB.
